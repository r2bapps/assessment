# Assessment Test

## Introduction
Assessment used for evaluating technical skills on Android development.

There is one approach for two different companies and assessments:
* Company A: [Marvel](https://developer.marvel.com/) data origin.
  * Reviewers have to register on [Marvel](https://developer.marvel.com/) to get an ID and create a file marvel.properties on project root with:
    * MARVEL_PRIVATE_KEY=<your-private-key> 
    * MARVEL_PUBLIC_KEY=<your-public-key> 
* Company B: [Randomuser](https://randomuser.me/) data origin.

Each data source is implemented on a diferent flavour, but they are sharing the most of the functionality. This approach can be seen as the same app but different country backends ðŸ¦– and with a bit different data sources.

## Reviewers considerations

Bugs, issues, bad practices, wrong implementations and all spaghetti code you find: [open an issue](https://github.com/r2bapps/assessment/issues/new/choose) please!

The assessment will be alive and well be improved for learning purposes.
